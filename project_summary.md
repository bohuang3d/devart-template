# Project Title
A Monument at Sea

## Authors
- Bo Huang @bohuang3d

## Description
Humans express feelings and intentions through writing, sounds, and images, often accompanied by flowers, cards, and momentos as mood setters and proof of dedication.

While we project feelings to these physical items, they are often artifacts of mass production, disconnected from event of focus. Just as our acts are manifestations of our feelings, ideally, these items would be growth of the emotion's natural metamorphosis.

This project applies these concepts as a tribute to the downing of flight MH370 and all lost at sea.
