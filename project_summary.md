## Description
Humans express feelings and intentions through writing, sounds, and images. Anyone can utter 'come back soon', but the tone, intensity, and style bless the phrase with life. Moreover, the act is often accompanied by flowers, cards, and momentos as mood setters and proof of dedication.

While we project feelings to these physical items, unless they are personally crafted, they are artifacts of mass production, disconnected from. Just as our acts are manifestations of our feelings, ideally, these items would also be the emotion's natural metamorphosis.

This project applies these concepts as a tribute to the downing of flight MH370
