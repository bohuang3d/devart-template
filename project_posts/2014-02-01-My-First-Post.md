Traditionally flowers are purchased from floral shops, and delivered to recipient on the same day. Thus one's emotionally attachment to them is non-existent, hence other than being ornaments unsuitable as a vessel of our feelings.

Our virtual flowers are different. Throughout their birth, maturity, and transcendance they can accompany the recipient, being virtually seeded at real world locations at senseEarth.com. As a virtual map of planet Earth, the flower can accompany your loved ones near and far.
