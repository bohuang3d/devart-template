In the middle of the ocean the monument may stand lonely. We can communicate to it in a fashion. SenseEarth.com hosts a vector graphics-like map of cities on Earth. In addition to visualizing one's local surroundings in a clean and stylized manner, one can also tag the map via placement of flowers leaving messages. The feature works for any locations on Earth, such as our monument's coordinates and surroundings. 

Thus we intend to utilize SenseEarth.com's service to empower interested parties to visit the monument, and as would be fitting for any formal and commemorative occasion, deliver one's blessings with flowers.

Visualization example of a sign (corresponding to monument perhaps), surrounded by flower field:

We will request these digital contributions and present a digital ensemble:
