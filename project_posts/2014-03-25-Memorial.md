In recent days flight MH370 has dominated news, sparking unprecedented international outpour of support. Vigils are held and tears shed, but the hearts of the bereaving cannot be at peace, likely never journey to the place of final descent nor recovery of loved one's body.

Building a memorial is an approriate form of tribute, especially at the location of final descent. But current technologies lend no practicality to oceanic architecture, and constructions on land or coast may be hard pressed in selecting relevant location. 

Unlike events that involve a clearly defined group, the MH270 incident involves global efforts but likely garners little political or interests group weight to justify a physical momento. Or if there were, one nation/group's gesture may not be inclusive of others.

Finally, not just the presumably deceased, the concerned living, service men and women, and all countries involved need rest and healing. Given the described difficulties, my eureka spark pushes me to form a tribute online. But quickly my mind pauses and I ask myself, would a less than perfect tribute release a torrent of fermenting anger in this difficult time? Would it trivialize physical monuments and traditional rites of passage?
