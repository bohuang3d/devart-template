A sculpture that transcends culture and nationalities is ultimately simple in form yet symbolic. The shape of the initial design resembles the vertical stabilizer of a modern aircraft. As the highest part of a plane, functionally it controls the yaw of the aircraft, responsible for the change of flight course reported, a pivotal point in this saga.

It may also be the last part descending into the sea, a reminder that the fuselage may lie below, with the remains of passengers. While some cultures may lament the misplacement of a body to complete rites and burial, but thinking in a different light, the passengers have returned to the cradle of life that is our oceans. 

Nonetheless, it is an upward rising sail, carrying the wishes of loved ones. Facing east towards Beijing, it yearns to return home.
