Thinking into my expressed doubt in the previous post, I look into the digital aspects of our lives. Most familiarly in this group's context, digital currencies in the form of bitcoin or virtual items in MMORPGs. Perhaps the most validating, credit card payment systems with decades of history is likely the mother of virtual currencies, little different from the 'credits' monikers bounced around in sci-fi movies. We, in a transitional period still refer to 'credits' as dollars in the bank.

More relevantly, the media already leads us to many places, be it remote or constructed. We readily view other parts of our planeth via CNN International, visit a simulated Mars on the Discovery Channel, and lively discuss sitcom characters as if they are our friends and family. Hence increasingly our local reality melds with the distant and imagined, in a virtuous cycle of creative enrichment of our base reality.

Thus I gather a memorial should not be an odd phenomenon. Rather, it should be as natural nowadays as a facebook page dedicated to certain events, but expressingly moving, artistic, and meaningful.
